# Poems

I created this [Laravel 8.x](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) project to combine the urge to collect some poems
and to try out things like [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), 
[Parsedown](https://github.com/parsedown/laravel) and some new features in Laravel, like the new factories
and Blade components.

I also initially tried out [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) but
decided against using it, as it was too extensive (bloated could be another word) for my purposes. 

This project is pretty barebones and since I'm only using it privately, there is no registration form
or anything. User management happens on the command line through [Laravel Tinker](https://github.com/laravel/tinker).
All users have access to everything implemented.

If you want to use it or fork it for your own purposes: go right ahead!
